# **Django E-commerce**
### *Hello guys! welcome to my django e-commerce project...*

## What makes this project stand out?
* Customized interactive admin panel using **bootstrap-admin**... Say bye bye to the default django Admin dashboard
* Categories and Sub-categories managed using&nbsp; **Django-MPTT** ... wanna know more about it! Click&nbsp; **[here](https://django-mptt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html)** 
* Integrated a text-editor package called&nbsp;**Django CKEditor** in Admin Panel which provides a rich text editing field with image uploading capability and many more other features
* Created **Auto-complete Search** &nbsp;functionality (like as in amazon,flipkart) using&nbsp; **jQuery AJAX Autocomplete Widget**... sounds cool right!
* **Multiple image gallery** &nbsp;for a single product(like as in amazon,flipkart) inside product details section 
* Users/Customers can&nbsp; **rate a product** and&nbsp; **write a review** on that product... Average rating&nbsp; is displayed out of total ratings count..
* **Detailed Specifications** of every products listed out..
* User can update their **profile/account information** any time they wish..
* Do you often forget passwords ? If yes, i got u...it supports the functionality to **reset passwords** using email.. Also u can **change your old passwords** anytime..
* Nevertheless&nbsp; **Checkout process** is also working perfect (in case you wonder ; it's just a fake checkout that let's user to enter credit card credentials and displays as payment done!.. Integrating payment gateway api for localhost projects is a tedious job)
